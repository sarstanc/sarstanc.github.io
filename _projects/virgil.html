  <p>In a typical theater, the space is top lit when an audience enters. When the performance begins the lights are dimmed and the stairways lit with exposed LED strips or not at all. The exposed LED option is visually distracting from the stage lighting while absence of light is dangerous.</p>

  <p>Virgil proposes a concealed lighting system that lights theater steps using a wash rather than an exposed LED strip. The luminaire responds to the position and movement of audience members, lighting only the steps in use. This allows for complete darkness in the theater, only interrupted when audience members enter and exit.</p>
